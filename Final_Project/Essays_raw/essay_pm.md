If I were to be made the prime minister of India, there are severla measures that I would love to take to make India stand out as best nation in the world. India is a hub of many cultures and its strenght lies in its diversity and such a diverse culture has the benefit of having a muti-dimensional thought process. People from different cultural, religious and social backgrounds have and will continue to come together and work and give different perspectives and ideas due to their different and unique outlooks. 

This cultural diversity needs to be protected and fostered. To do this I would take measures to improve the harmony among the different sections of society. Organising annual events and Cutural fests across the country that bring people from different corners of the nation will allow them to interact, share ideas and learn from one another.

One important aspect/measure that I would like to work on would be to make most out of the Demographic Dividend that is present in this nation. Our nation is a youthful and young nation and it would be a huge disservice to not make use of this demographic devident. I would take measures to increase employment oppurtunities for the youth by increasing investments in the Service sector to help in the setting up of more industries, but at the same time I would promote indigenous practices of farming and handloom weaving in the nation to protect the rich culture and would promote studentns to take up these professions to help promote employment and development of these sectors. One more aspect to it would be to promote the formation of more Start-Ups to encourage the youth to work for themselves and innovate and create more emplyment opportunities for others. This will be done through increase of foreign angel investments in India to promote innovative ideas and promote privatisation of sectors to take the load off of the government sectors and companies.

One major aspect/measure that I would work on would be to increase annual share of GDP in the Education and Healthcare sector, which are two of the most, if not the most important sectors in the development of a self-reliant and economically stable nation. The first major change in the education sector that I would make would be to increase the focus on coding and programming to create that sense of critical thinking, reasoning abilities and creativity among the students. Programming and skills in software is required in almost every sector and field in todayâ€™s world and it is a necessary skill. More vocational education needs to be encouraged to break the trend of the traditional mindset of students and parents that only Doctors and Engineers in India can be successful.

As far as the health sector is concerced, more privatisation is required. The population of the nation is quite large, and only a few government hospitals have good facilities that majority of the population cannot access due to lack of resources. Due to this, many people with major illnesses go untreated. Privatisation of this sector already took place years ago but more private hospitals need to be created and their charges need to be capped to ensure that people who need these facilities the most can access them withouth major hinderance.
